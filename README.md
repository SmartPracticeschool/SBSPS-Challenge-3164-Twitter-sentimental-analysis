# SBSPS-Challenge-3164-Twitter-sentimental-analysis
General Description

The social networking site, Twitter, demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. The Coronavirus pandemic has taken the world by storm as also the social media and people are actively sharing their thoughts on twitter and therefore sentiment analysis can be conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this time. 
The cloud-based Twitter Live Dashboards based on Machine Learning and NLP algorithms can provide meaningful analysis. Furthermore, necessary information can be shared back using predefined hashtags. Using various existing technologies such as python ,Node Red, BM Watson studio and IBM cloud for deployment, it’s possible to deploy our project. 
The latest ML & AI heatmaps are used to trace and filter out the misinformation floating and provide us with accurate data streaming to analyze and visualize it on live dashboards.
As these tweets triggered most discussions online, we now know people’s primary concerns and by taking into consideration into obvious keywords we can perform sentimental analysis. Keywords such: Masks,Covid-19,Red zone,Pandemic.


Novelty / Uniqueness

The Coronavirus pandemic has taken the world by storm as also the social media. As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos and posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter, demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time.Sentiment analysis has been conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. 

As these tweets triggered most discussions online, we now know people’s primary concerns:
1. They are not sure who needs to wear a mask to minimize infection risk.
2. They are hesitant about the original travel plan.
3. They pay attention to the policy changes in Covid-19 prevention.
4. They remind people who show symptoms to take action.
5. The panic shopping mode for masks is still going on.

Here if we can add a collection of regularly updated responsive embeddable charts and maps about the coronavirus crisis.
1. Interactive trajectory chart for cases and deaths
2. Breakdown of cases/deaths by region and country
3. Searchable cases line chart with linear/log toggle
4. World map of cases and deaths
5. Europe-focused map of cases and deaths
6. Table of reported cases
7. Source notes and caveats

Increasing our use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and manipulative content.

How are we using automated technology during this time?
1. To help us review reports more efficiently by surfacing content that's most likely to cause harm and should be reviewed first.
2. To help us proactively identify rule-breaking content before it's reported. Our systems learn from past decisions by our review teams, so over time, the technology is able to help us rank content or challenge accounts automatically.
3. For content that requires additional context, such as misleading information around COVID-19, our teams will continue to review those reports manually.


About Ideas

How Twitter Live Dashboards can help Authorities

1.Twitter data extraction and data mining can significantly help doctors and government authorities to adequately understand the critical disease, its patterns, and symptoms and present them with valuable insights to promptly arrive at the appropriate treatment, medicines, and preventive guidelines.

2.Cloud-based Twitter Live Dashboards based on Machine Learning and NLP algorithms can provide meaningful analysis to deal with such Pandemic like Coronavirus(Covid-19).

3.There are millions of authentic tweets concerning Coronavirus originating at all the time. These tweets hold vital information that can help us understand the disease and its root causes. The latest ML & AI heatmaps are used to trace and filter out the misinformation floating and provide us with accurate data streaming to analyze and visualize it on live dashboards.

4.These live dashboards can quickly indicate the authorities about variety of emerging patterns, and symptoms, locations, treatments, medicines, vaccines, etc. which could be a lifesaver for many if implemented on time. Furthermore, necessary information can be shared back using predefined hashtags.

Scope of Work

This research work is aimed at analyzing the sentiments and emotions of the people during the pandemic COVID19. This study will help us revealed which countries have a positive sentiment and which countries have a negative sentiment with the help of tweeting about COVID19.  Similarly,  while  analyzing  the  word  clouds  of  different countries, we will be able to find out what kind of words people are tweeting, for instance, Pandemic, Death, Quarantine, Hope, Stay Safe,  with different emotions.  The tweets which will be collected for this study will be in English language which might serve as a limitation for the study. For the future works, this study can be used to analyze the changing emotions and sentiments of people from these countries and check whether there are major shifts in them over the period of  time.  It  is  expected  that  as  the  spread  of  this  pandemic  will  increase,  the  sentiments  and emotions in the tweets may change on the lines of what was seen in the case of China.
